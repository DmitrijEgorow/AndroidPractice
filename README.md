## Android Practice Tasks

This repository contains several practical assignments for automated testing system for Android applications, specifically designed for Samsung Innovation Campus courses. 
It includes both server templates and partially implemented starter projects for students to complete.

### Repository Structure

Each practical assignment contributes to 2 branches:

* **`server_` branch** contains the complete and functional UI test templates. These templates showcase best practices (primarily, modularisation, see a standalone linked GitHub repository [in the androidTest folder](https://github.com/DmitrijEgorow/AndroidPractice/tree/362860a92beec1eee5f36aa5d8d7814af2861df1/app/src/androidTest/java/ru/myitschool/lab23)) and cover various testing scenarios.
* **`student_` branch** contains partially implemented projects that provide students with a starting point for their full-featured apps. Students are expected to fill in the missing code to pass the tests.
